abstract: "We propose the novel application of dynamic and interactive visualisation
techniques to support the iterative and exploratory investigations typical of
the corpus linguistics methodology. Very large scale text analysis is already
carried out in corpus-based language analysis by employing methods such
as frequency profiling, keywords, concordancing, collocations and n-grams.
However, at present only basic visualisation methods are utilised. In this
paper, we describe case studies of multiple types of key word clouds, explorer
tools for collocation networks, and compare network and language distance
visualisations for online social networks. These are shown to fit better
with the iterative data-driven corpus methodology, and permit some level
of scalability to cope with ever increasing corpus size and complexity. In
addition, they will allow corpus linguistic methods to be used more widely
in the digital humanities and social sciences since the learning curve with
visualisations is shallower for non-experts."
